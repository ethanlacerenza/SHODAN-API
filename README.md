# Shodan Search Tool

- This Python script allows you to perform searches on Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices. It retrieves results from Shodan's API, formats them, and saves them in a JSON file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, you need to have the following:

- Shodan API Key: Sign up for a Shodan account and obtain an API key. You will need to set this API key as an environment variable.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shodan-search-tool.git
   ```
Navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

   ```
   python3 src/ShodanAPI-json.py
   ```
   


The script will perform the Shodan search, format the results, and save them to a JSON file named shodan_results.json in the same directory.
