# Shodan Search Tool

This Python script allows you to perform searches on Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices. It retrieves results from Shodan's API, formats them, and saves them in a JSON file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, you need to have the following:

- Shodan API Key: Sign up for a Shodan account and obtain an API key. You will need to set this API key as an environment variable.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shodan-search-tool.git
Navigate to the project directory:



cd shodan-search-tool
Set your Shodan API key as an environment variable:

On Windows:
